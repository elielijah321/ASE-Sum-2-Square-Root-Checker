The Square number checker app is a web application built with React and Bootstrap that allows users to input a number and determine if it is a perfect square. The app provides two main functionalities; it checks if the entered number is a square number and calculates the square root of that number. The app has a simple and user-friendly interface that includes an input field for the number to be checked, a submit button to initiate the check and a message section that displays the results of the check.



**Reason for creating the app**

The Square number checker app was created as a prototype for the organization I work for to determine the viability of using React as a technology for building web applications. The decision to introduce React into the organization's tech stack was made with the aim of improving the performance and maintainability of their applications. To assess the feasibility of using React, the organization wanted to develop a small-scale application that would demonstrate the capabilities of the technology.

The Square number checker app was chosen as the prototype because it was relatively simple to build, but still required some complex logic and user interaction. It provided a solid foundation for further exploration and development, and helped to set the stage for future innovation and growth.
