The Square number checker app is a web application built with React and Bootstrap that allows users to input a number and determine if it is a perfect square. The app provides two main functionalities; it checks if the entered number is a square number and calculates the square root of that number. The app has a simple and user-friendly interface that includes an input field for the number to be checked, a submit button to initiate the check and a message section that displays the results of the check.


**Reason for creating the app**

The Square number checker app was created as a prototype for the organization I work for to determine the viability of using React as a technology for building web applications. The decision to introduce React into the organization's tech stack was made with the aim of improving the performance and maintainability of their applications. To assess the feasibility of using React, the organization wanted to develop a small-scale application that would demonstrate the capabilities of the technology.

The Square number checker app was chosen as the prototype because it was relatively simple to build, but still required some complex logic and user interaction. It provided a solid foundation for further exploration and development, and helped to set the stage for future innovation and growth. 


**Performance and Accessibility Testing**

I evaluated and improved my webpage's quality using the Google Lighthouse tool, which is free and accessible through the development console for Chromium-based browsers. This tool generates a report that summarizes various quality metrics, including performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO.

The performance metric evaluated loading speed, time for loading basic frames, and displaying meaningful content. Accessibility evaluated the website's accessibility for users with disabilities through audio captions, button names, and 'aria-' attributes. Best practices evaluated many practices deemed 'best,' such as using HTTPS and avoiding deprecated code. SEO analyzed features such as meta descriptions, titles, and font sizes.

The website scored highly in all four metrics, with a performance rating of 100, an accessibility rating of 96, a best practices rating of 100, and an SEO rating of 100. This means the website is highly optimized, easy to navigate, and attracts high-quality internet traffic naturally without the need for advertising.

## Coding Practice

I have made sure that the code is easy to read and comprehend by following the correct naming and coding conventions. I used camelCase and code indentation throughout the codebase to achieve this. Comments were used to allow other who have not worked on the project to understand what is being done.
